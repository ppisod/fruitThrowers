# Implementation of fruits 
```
Insert your fruit as a modulescript in this folder. 
Make sure it returns an array.
Every module requires fields/methods:
- EquipCooldown which is a Number
- a function Instantiate (Position: Vector3, Direction: Vector3) -> void

Then, go to Fruit.luau in server / Data / _Ref and add your fruit as a field in m.Fruits, and add your module. 

Then, add your fruit to m.iterableFruits
